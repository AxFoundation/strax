Strax is an analysis framework for pulse-only digitization data, specialized for live data reduction at speeds of 50-100 MB(raw) / core / sec. 
It's primary aim is to support noble liquid TPC dark matter searches, such as XENONnT.

For more information, please see the [strax documentation](https://strax.readthedocs.io).
