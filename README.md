Strax is an analysis framework for pulse-only digitization data, specialized for live data reduction at speeds of 50-100 MB(raw) / core / sec. For more information, please see the [strax documentation](https://strax.readthedocs.io).

Strax' primary aim is to support noble liquid TPC dark matter searches, such as XENONnT. The XENON-specific algorithms live in the separate package [straxen](https://github.com/XENONnT/straxen). If you want to try out strax, you probably want to start there. This package only contains the core framework and basic algorithms any TPCs would want to use.
