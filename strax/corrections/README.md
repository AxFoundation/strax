# Correction Management Tool

Corrections are an important part of the event building process, applying these corrections help us to remove detectors effects so we can have a “correct” measurement. Having a common tool that maintains and does bookkeeping is beneficial. Thus, we are proposing a corrections management tool (CMT). Corrections are placed in DB, the format is a panda DataFrame with DatetimeIndex.
