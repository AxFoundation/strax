Superruns
=========

Overview and motivation
------------------------
A superrun is a run defined by (parts of) other runs, which are called 'subruns'. Superrun names start with an underscore. Regular run names cannot start with an underscore.

Strax builds data for a superrun by loading (and potentially building) each of the subruns, then slicing and concatenating them as necessary.

Superruns are useful to track common groupings of data. For example:

* 'Minimum bias' runs, consisting only of low-energy events, events passing some cuts, DM-candidates, PMT flashes, or other thing of interest. The low-level data of these is much smaller than that of all the full runs, and can be brought to a local analysis facility, enabling on-site low-level waveform watching.
* Grouping similar runs. For example, shifters might group good runs from a week of calibration data with some source under a single name, e.g. `_kr_feb2019`.



Superruns can be built from other superruns. Thus, _sr1_v0.2 could be built from _background_january, _background_february, etc.


Defining superruns
-------------------
Use the `define_run` context method to define a new superrun. There are three ways to do this.

From a list of runids::

    st.define_run('_awesome_superrun', ['123', '124'])

From a dictionary of time range tuples. The times must be 64-bit integer UTC timestamps since the unix epoch::

    st.define_run('_awesome_superrun', {
        '123': [(start, stop), (start, stop), ...],
        '124': [(start, stop), (start, stop), ...],})

From a dataframe (or record array) with strax data::

    st.define_run('_awesome_superrun', events_df)
    st.define_run('_awesome_superrun', events_df, from_run='123')

In this case, the run will be made of the time ranges that correspond exactly to `events_df`. If `events_df` already has a `run_id` field (e.g. because it consists of data from multiple runs), you do not need to pass `from_run`, it will be read off from the data.

It is up to the storage frontent to process your request for defining a run. As a normal user, you generally only have permissions to create a new run in the `DataDirectory` (local files) storage frontend, where runs are recorded in json files.


How superruns work
--------------------

As mentioned above, strax builds data for superruns by slicing data of the subruns. Thus, peaks from a superrun come from the peaks of the subruns, which are built from their own records as usual.

Defaults for settings can be runid-dependent in strax. If an option specifies `default_per_run=[(run, setting), (run2, setting2)]`, then runs in between run and run2 will use setting, and runs after run2 `setting2`. Superruns store a deterministic hash of this `default_per_run` specification for tracking purposes.

You cannot currently go directly from the superrun's records to the superrun's peaks. This would be tricky to implement, since (1) (2) even with the same settings, many plugins choose to do something different depending on the runid. For example, in straxen the gain model is specified by a file, but which gains from the file are actually used is dependent on the runid.

Thus, superruns won't help build data faster, but they will speed up loading data after it has been built. This is important, because strax' overhead for loading a run is larger than hax, due to its version and option tracking.
