Strax is an analysis framework for pulse-only digitization data,
specialized for live data processing at speeds of 50-100 MB(raw) / core / sec.

For comparison, this is more than 100x faster than the XENON1T processor `pax <http://github.com/XENON1T/pax>`_,
and does not require a preprocessing stage ('eventbuilder').
It achieves this due to using `numpy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/>`_ `structured arrays <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html>`_ internally,
which are supported by the amazing just-in-time compiler `numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_.

Strax is primarily developed for the XENONnT experiment, although the configuration and specific algorithms for XENONnT are hosted at `<https://github.com/XENONnT/straxen>`_. You can find its documentation `here <https://straxen.readthedocs.io>`_.

The above pages describe how strax's processing framework works under the hood, and explains some implementation choices. It's meant for people who want to do core development on strax; users or even plugin developers should not need it.
