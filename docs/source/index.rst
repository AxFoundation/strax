Strax is an analysis framework for pulse-only digitization data,
specialized for live data processing at speeds of 50-100 MB(raw) / core / sec.

For comparison, this is more than 100x faster than the XENON1T processor `pax <http://github.com/XENON1T/pax>`_,
and does not require a preprocessing stage ('eventbuilder').
It achieves this due to using `numpy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/>`_ `structured arrays <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html>`_ internally,
which are supported by the amazing just-in-time compiler `numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_.

Strax is initially developed for the XENONnT experiment. However, the configuration
and specific algorithms for XENONnT will eventually be hosted separately.

Besides the documentation below, you might find these presentations useful:

The above pages describe how strax's processing framework works under the hood, and explains some implementation choices. It's meant for people who want to do core development on strax; users or even plugin developers should not need it.
